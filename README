#An attempt to recreate the path share button in css3 only

This is just a little project for me to play with CSS3 transitions and transformations.

Some notes on what's missing:
* + x button should really be the same element with a toggle. Consider using :checked+div for a sibling maneuver that could then make it checked and unchecked for a pure css3 toggle
* brief shadow overlay of the + x button on click (:active? not sure)
* bounce of icons after splaying out along the curve. Could require keyframe animations, which feels like giving up.
